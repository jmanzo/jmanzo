## :hand: Hi, I am Fullstack Developer!

For now, I'm focused on E-commerce solutions. I create plugins, themes and apps for **Wordpress, Woocommerce and Shopify**.
I've had the chance to be immersed in a variety of projects where I've learned to work with a big scope of tech stacks.

## What I'm focusing on right now :computer:

My main goal is to provide value to the world, and I've chosen e-commerce because itâ€™s an exciting field where my strengths are most applicable. I create solutions for merchants and customers, allowing them to focus on their business and leave the technical details to me.
